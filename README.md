Festus Okagbare | Frontend Stage 1 Task

Description
This project is part of the **HNG Frontend Stage 1 Task**, extending my Stage 0 profile card into a **multi-page responsive web application**.

The application showcases my professional profile with an **About Me** page and a **Contact Us** page featuring form validation and accessibility support.

### Pages Included

1. **Home Page (`index.html`)**
   Displays a styled profile card with navigation links to the About and Contact pages, plus social media links.

2. **About Me Page (`about.html`)**
   A reflective page containing my biography, goals, challenges, notes to my future self, and extra thoughts. Built with semantic HTML elements and accessible structure.

3. **Contact Us Page (`contact.html`)**
   A form page with proper validation rules for name, email, subject, and message fields. Validation ensures data integrity and user feedback through visible error and success messages.

Each page follows **semantic HTML**, **accessibility (A11y)** principles, and **responsive design** for smooth usability across devices.
